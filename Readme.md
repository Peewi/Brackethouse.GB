# A Game Boy Emulator
This is an emulator of the original monochrome Game Boy. It was written by Lau Laursen for fun and programming practice.

The emulation works, though sound is currently not emulated and there are no extra features.

Currently, only keyboard controls are available and they are not customizable.
- Arrow keys: D-pad
- S: A button
- A: B button
- Enter: Start button
- Backspace: Select button
